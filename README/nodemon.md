# Nodemon Branch

## Purpose
Nodemon is used to keep the server process alive in development environment, and to reload the server when Gulp file or files in server/folder are updated.

## Usage
* 'gulp serve:keepalive' or gulp serve' or 'gulp' to start server in keepalive mode with Nodemon
* 'gulp serve:once' to start server without Nodemon
